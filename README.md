# Directory structure

The repo has the following directory structure.

    ## 
    ## project directory
    ##   |-- .here
    ##   |  o-- object of type(s):file
    ##   |-- README.md
    ##   |  o-- object of type(s):file
    ##   |-- revn/

    ##   |-- data/
    ##   |  o-- object of type(s):dir
    ##   o-- output/
    ##      o-- object of type(s):dir

Structure of the subdirectories includes:

-   `preprocessing/`: Source files for executing core modeling code,
    generating simulated data, and running simulations
    -   `estimate_flode.R`: Defines function for estimating `flode`
        model using EM algorithm
    -   `make_pffr.R`: Defines function for running functional
        historical regression model and processing surfaces for
        visualization
    -   `search_alpha.R`: Defines function to perform grid search over
        possible *Î±*<sub>0</sub> values to choose best initial value.
    -   `simulated_paw.R`: Defines function for simulating data.
    -   `utils.R`: Defines helper functions called in the
        `estimate_flode.R` file.
    -   `simulations/`: File for generating simulation results across
        all simulation scenarios.
        -   `20211227_simulations_flodeVSfhist.R`: Compares flode and
            functional historical regression across 9 alpha values for
            30 datasets each.
        -   `20211228_simulations_flode.R`: Evaluates flode across 4
            sample sizes and 3 alpha values for 30 datasets each.
-   `analysis/`
    -   `202112_dataAnalysis.Rmd/.html`: Code/output for processing paw
        trajectory data and generating Figures 1, 6, and 7 in the
        manuscript

## Notes about this repo/workflow

Describe file structure and workflow here

-   Slow steps are cached or saved as R data objects that are read in
    the next time a file is run- this makes it faster to run the
    Rmarkdown files that generate analysis results
-   The file `202112_simulation_results.Rmd` creates and saves Figures
    2, 3, 4 and 5 and stores them as `.png` files in the `output` folder
-   The file `202112_dataAnalysis.Rmd` creates and saves Figures 1, 6,
    and 7 and stores them in the `output` folder. Also creates and saves
    to `output` a dataframe of computation times and parameter values
    that are reported as part of inline text in the `manuscript.Rmd`.
    This allows all inline `R` code from the `manuscript.Rmd` to be
    fully reproducible (not entered by hand).
-   To generate the manuscript knit the file `manuscript.Rmd` in the
    `manuscript` folder. This does not execute the full analysis but
    reads in figures and numbers in the `output` folder generated by
    knitting `202112_simulation_results.Rmd` and
    `202112_dataAnalysis.Rmd`.

# Thoughts

-   easily could have this same format whether manuscripts are generated
    using R Markdown or Latex
-   probably best to have users clone the repo rather than fork it so
    they can rename it?
