Each of the files and subdirectories in this repository are described
below.

    complete)
-   `analysis/`
    -   `202112_dataAnalysis.Rmd/.html`: Code/output for processing raw
        paw trajectory data and generating Figures 1, 6, and 7 in the
        manuscript.
    -   `202112_simulation_results.Rmd/.html`: Code/output for
        processing simulation results and generating Figures 2, 3, 4,
        and 5 in the manuscript.
-   `data/`: Raw paw trajectory data (not currently included)
-   `manuscript/`: manuscript files including `.Rmd` template

        possible *Î±*<sub>0</sub> values to choose best initial value.
    -   `simulated_paw.R`: Defines function for simulating data.
    -   `utils.R`: Defines helper functions called in the
        `estimate_flode.R` file.

            functional historical regression across 9 alpha values for
            30 datasets each.
        -   `20211228_simulations_flode.R`: Evaluates flode across 4
            sample sizes and 3 alpha values for 30 datasets each.

## Workflow

Describe file structure and workflow here

-   Slow steps are cached or saved as R data objects that are read in
    the next time a file is run- this makes it faster to run the
    Rmarkdown files that generate analysis results

1.  Execute the file `202112_simulation_results.Rmd` to create Figures
    2, 3, 4 and 5 and save them as `.png` files in the `output` folder.

2.  Execute the file `202112_dataAnalysis.Rmd` to create Figures 1, 6,
    and 7 and save them as `.png` files in the `output` folder. Also
    creates and saves to `output` a dataframe of computation times and
    parameter values that are reported as part of inline text in the
    `manuscript.Rmd`. This allows all inline `R` code from the
    `manuscript.Rmd` to be fully reproducible (not entered by hand).

3.  To generate the manuscript knit the file `manuscript.Rmd` in the
    `manuscript` folder. This does not execute the full analysis but
    reads in figures and numbers in the `output` folder generated by
    knitting `202112_simulation_results.Rmd` and
    `202112_dataAnalysis.Rmd`.

## Other thoughts

-   easily could have this same format whether manuscripts are generated
    using R Markdown or Latex
-   probably best to have users clone the repo rather than fork it so
    they can rename it?
